# Project Title: My React Portfolio 

## Project Description

This project is a web application built using React and Javascript/TypeScript. It demonstrates my ability to create dynamic , responsive and interactive user interfaces using modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries. The application is styled using Tailwind CSS, showcasing my understanding of layout design and responsive styling. The structure of the application is defined using HTML, demonstrating my ability to create well-structured and semantically meaningful web pages.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run :

### `npm install`

Before you can run or build the application, you need to install its dependencies. Run this command in the project directory to install all the dependencies defined in the `package.json` file. This command only needs to be run once, or whenever the dependencies are updated.

## Running the App Locally

1. Navigate to the `my-app` directory:

```bash
cd my-app



This command launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. For more information, see the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This command builds the application for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your application is now ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and give you full control over the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc).
